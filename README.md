<h1>StoryTeller is a discord bot that can produce deathbattle stories from any two characters, real or fictional.</h1> 
<h6>don't tell anyone but it uses chatGPT!</h6>

<h2>How do I setup the StoryTeller?</h2>
Great question, me!

You will need to go through the normal process of creating a bot before you can use these files.  
Those steps can be found [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started).   
Once you finnish that just download the files add a .env file with the requisite discord token key in TOKEN_STORY,
the openai api key in TOKEN_GPT, and the organization id in ORG_ID.  

<h5>After setup simply use the command '/tell_me *character_1* *character_2* to get a story!</h5>
<h5>Now you are off to the storytelling races! Have fun!</h5>
